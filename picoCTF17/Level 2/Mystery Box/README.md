# Challenge

You've found a mystery machine with a sticky note attached to it! Oh, there's also this picture of the machine you found.

# Walkthrough/Solution

We are provided with the information:

```
Geheimnis: PXQQ TAMY YDBC WGYE LVN
Umkehrwalze: B
Grundstellung: PPP
Ringstellung: LOG
Steckerbrett: G-L, H-F
```
Doing a google reverse image search of the picture tells us that it is an engima decoder. I used this [site](http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/enigma.html) to decode the message. 

Reading the [emulator help](http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/help.html) and inputting the correct fields, we get the flag `QUIT EPUZ ZLIN GIND EED`.

# Learning Outcome
1) Online tools/Google reverse image search
