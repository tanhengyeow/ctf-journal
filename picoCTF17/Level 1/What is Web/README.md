# Challenge

Someone told me that some guy came up with the "World Wide Web", using "HTML" and "stuff". Can you help me figure out what that is? Website.

# Walkthrough/Solution

Upon visiting the webpage, we are presented with a cat image and a clickable button. Viewing the page source of the webpage gives us the first part of the flag. </br></br> 
We noticed that there is a css file which produces the style of this webpage. Clicking on it gives us the second part of the flag.</br></br> 
Next, we also noticed that there is a .js (javascript file) that forms the clickable button. Clicking on the script gives us the third part of the flag. </br></br> 
Piecing the flag together gives us `fab79c49d9e5ba511a0f2436308e33e85`
