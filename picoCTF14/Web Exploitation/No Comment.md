# Challenge 

The CD you find has a copy of your father's website: homepage.html. Maybe something is hidden in the site...

# Solution

Going to the homepage.html and viewing the page source by `right clicking > view Page Source`, we found the password `flag_f2ebbc0e7e4c41eb5628bb3d77ecb871190cd97b`

# Learning Outcome

Source code of websites can be viewed by anyone, so don't store sensitive information inside.
