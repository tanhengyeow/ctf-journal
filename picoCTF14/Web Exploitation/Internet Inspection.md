# Challenge

On his computer, your father left open a browser with the Thyrin Lab Website. Can you find the hidden access code?

# Walkthrough/Solution

Viewing the page source doesn't give us much information and it says the problem can be easily solved using developer tools. To access developer tools, `right click > Inspect`. We noticed that under the body section, there are styles added a checker image embedded on top of some text. Removing their element through the webpage shows us the password `flag_48ed0ad97f81fa674501d298ef00c3b213bf5294`

# Learning outcome

User has controls to the elements on a static webpage.
