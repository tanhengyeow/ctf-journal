# Challenge

The hard drive may be corrupted, but you were able to recover a small chunk of text. Scribbled on the back of the hard drive is a set of mysterious numbers. Can you discover the meaning behind these numbers? (1, 9, 4) (4, 2, 8) (4, 8, 3) (7, 1, 5) (8, 10, 1)

# Walkthrough/Solution

Upon viewing the text, we see 8 paragraphs of text. The largest number of the first numbers of each bracket seems to be 8, which hinted us that the first number might be the paragraph number. A paragraphs is made up of lines of words and trying the combination that the second digit represents the line number and the third number represents the position of the word, we get the flag `the flag is Ceremonial plates`
