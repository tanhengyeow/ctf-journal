# Challenge

This disc is encrypted. The surprisingly elaborate password hint refers to "the CVE Identifier for a 2014 vulnerability that allowed arbitrary code execution in Firefox via a buffer overflow in a speech codec". If you found this "CVE-ID" thingy, it'd probably be the password.

# Solution

Googling "CVE identifier 2014 arbitrary code execution" gives us the full name of the vulnerability, `CVE-2014-1542 MFSA2014-53 Firefox`.

# Learning Outcome

1) Google skills
2) CVE, which is a database of known vulnerabilities
