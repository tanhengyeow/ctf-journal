The book has instructions on how to dump the corrupted configuration file from the robot's memory. You find a corrupted XML file and are looking for a configuration key.

# Walkthrough/Solution

XML is a file extension for an Extensible Markup Language (XML) file format used to create common information formats and share both the format and the data on the World Wide Web, intranets, and elsewhere using standard ASCII text. XML is similar to HTML. Both XML and HTML contain markup symbols to describe the contents of a page or file. HTML, however, describes the content of a Web page (mainly text and graphic images) only in terms of how it is to be displayed and interacted with. Right clicking the webpage and viewing the source shows us the flag.

# Learning outcome

1) Don't store sensitive information on the page source as anyone has access to it.
