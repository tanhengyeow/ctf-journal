Score: 20

After opening the robot's front panel and looking inside, you discover a small red button behind a tangle of wires. Pressing the button lights up the robot's primary screen. It glows black and quickly flashes blue. A line of small text types out: <br /><br /> `ERROR: 0x00000023` <br /><br />
The text refreshes and displays the prompt: <br /><br />
`FILE SYSTEM RECOVERY INITIATED...
FILE SYSTEM COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED...
PLEASE ENTER FILE SYSTEM FORMAT:`

# Solution

Googling `ERROR: 0x00000023` shows that the error originated from a FAT Filesystem.

# Learning Outcome
